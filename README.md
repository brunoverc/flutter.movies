# Flutter Project - Consuming TMDB API

This is a Flutter project that consumes the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie information, including the most popular movies at the moment and details of selected movies.

## Description

The Movie Database (TMDb) is a free and open-source database of movies and TV series. This project uses the TMDb API to display information about popular movies, including details like release date, synopsis, and more.
